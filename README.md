# Web-app Test deployment using Jenkins

We are building test web-application image using this Dockerfile and deploying it to the Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins.

Whole idea is to automate image building and deploy custom web-application to the Kubernetes cluster.

## 1. Configure webhook in the DockerHub to auto build image once code is commited to the GitHub repo.

Here is DockerHub image location:

GitHub to Jenkins web-hook configuration:  [poyaskov/test-web-app](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/poyaskov/test-web-app)


## 2. Build Docker image based on gitHub repo




## 3. Create k8s deployment


Test web-app for bla-bla
initiate web-hook 3
